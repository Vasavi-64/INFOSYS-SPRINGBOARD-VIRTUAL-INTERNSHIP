Project Overview

ElectViz is a data visualization and analytical project designed to transform raw election data into meaningful, interactive insights. The project focuses on analyzing election trends, voter behavior, party performance, and constituency-level results using data analytics and visualization techniques.

This project was developed as part of an internship and later redesigned, enhanced, and implemented individually as an academic project to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis, dashboard design, and storytelling using data.
